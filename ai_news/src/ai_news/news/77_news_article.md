# GMD: Moving Beyond Post Hoc Explainable AI â€“ Lessons from Dynamical Climate Modeling

A new perspective paper published in *Geoscientific Model Development (GMD)* challenges the limitations of current explainable AI (XAI) methods and proposes a more integrated approach to understanding complex AI models.  The paper, "GMD - Moving beyond post hoc explainable artificial intelligence: a perspective paper on lessons learned from dynamical climate modeling," argues that traditional "post hoc" XAI techniques, which attempt to explain AI decisions after the fact, often fall short, especially when dealing with intricate systems.

## The Limitations of Post Hoc XAI

The authors highlight the difficulties in interpreting the results of complex AI models, drawing parallels to the challenges faced in understanding complex climate simulations.  The inherent non-linearity and complexity of these systems make it difficult to isolate individual factors contributing to the model's output.  Post hoc methods, therefore, often fail to provide meaningful insights into the decision-making process of the AI.

## The Promise of Integrated Explainability

The paper advocates for a paradigm shift towards "integrated explainability," where explainability is considered from the initial stages of model design and development.  This approach emphasizes building models with inherent transparency and incorporating mechanisms for understanding their internal workings.  The authors suggest that the established practices within dynamical climate modeling, which prioritize model transparency and rigorous validation, offer valuable lessons for improving XAI.

## Lessons from Dynamical Climate Modeling

The paper identifies key lessons from dynamical climate modeling applicable to improving AI explainability:

* **Model Transparency:** Designing models with easily understood internal workings. This allows for a more direct understanding of how the model arrives at its conclusions.

* **Rigorous Validation:** Thoroughly testing and validating models against real-world observations to ensure accuracy and reliability.  This helps to build confidence in the model's outputs and explanations.

* **Sensitivity Analysis:** Identifying the key factors influencing model outputs. This helps to pinpoint the most important variables and understand their impact on the model's predictions.

* **Ensemble Methods:** Utilizing multiple models to improve robustness and understanding.  Comparing the results of different models can highlight areas of agreement and disagreement, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the system being modeled.


By adopting these principles, the authors argue that we can develop AI models that are not only accurate and effective but also inherently explainable, fostering
